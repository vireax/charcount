=========

Count the number of Khmer characters

* Written in Python
* Retrieve web url
* extract text
* Count Khmer character
* Demo in PHP http://demo.ximplex.net/keyboard

## Features

### 'test6.py' ###

* open a web address
* pull all text
* count the number of each character
* plot histogram: frequency vs. decimal code (require matplotlib)

### What's next ###

* read from a list of web sites (valid, no error, no redirect)
* summarize data in descriptive statistics

### What's more

* n-gram using NLTK library

## Practical use

* I can only think of redesigning keyboard layout by keeping the most frequent character on the home row
* n-gram can affect the the placement of vowels and fingers' effective range
* physically, relative position of vowels to the main consonant should affect the arrangement
* socially, many people will be againts this idea because we don't usually break the custom out of personal motivation
* technically, engineers should be able to prove a better design scientifically
